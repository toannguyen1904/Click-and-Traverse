## News

- 2026/03/07: We release the **real-world deployment code** of CAT! Please refer to deploy/Click-and-Traverse-SLAM for details.
- 2026/01/08: We release the official implementation of CAT!

---

The project addresses the problem of enabling humanoid robots to safely traverse **cluttered indoor scenes**, which we define as environments that simultaneously exhibit:

- **Full-spatial constraints**: obstacles jointly present at the *ground*, *lateral*, and *overhead* levels, restricting the humanoid’s motion in all spatial dimensions.
- **Intricate geometries**: obstacles with complex, irregular shapes that go beyond simple primitives such as rectangular blocks or regular polyhedra.

</p>

In this repository, we present:

- **Humanoid Potential Field (HumanoidPF)**: a structured representation encoding spatial relationships between the humanoid body and surrounding obstacles;
- **Hybrid scene generation**: realistic 3D indoor scene crops combined with procedurally synthesized obstacles;
- **Reinforcement learning for specialist and generalist policies**, respectively trained on specific scenes and distilled to a generalist policy.

## Hybrid Obstacle Generation & HumanoidPF

Two categories of obstacle scenes are supported:

- **Typical obstacles**: manually designed, semantically meaningful scenes
- **Random obstacles**: procedurally generated scenes with controllable difficulty

HumanoidPF representations are generated synchronously for all scenes.

Outputs are saved to:

- `data/assets/TypiObs/`
- `data/assets/RandObs/`

### Generate Typical Obstacles

```bash
export PATH=/usr/local/cuda-12.5/bin:$PATH
source .env
source .venv/bin/activate
cd procedural_obstacle_generation
```

Edit `main.py` and call:

```python
generate_typical_obstacle(obs_name)
```

Parameters:

- `obs_name`: the obstacle configuration (see comments in `main.py`).

### Generate Random Obstacles

Call in `main.py`:

```python
generate_random_obstacle(difficulty, seed, dL, dG, dO)
```

Parameters:

- `difficulty`: global difficulty level
- `seed`: random seed
- `dL`: lateral obstacle difficulty
- `dG`: ground obstacle difficulty
- `dO`: overhead obstacle difficulty

## Traversal Skill Learning

### Training

```bash
export PATH=/usr/local/cuda-12.5/bin:$PATH
source .env
source .venv/bin/activate
python train_batch.py
```

If you want to train a specific experiment, you can run:

```bash
python -m train_ppo --task {task} --restore_name {restore_name} --exp_name {exp_name}  --ground {ground} --lateral {lateral} --overhead {overhead} --term_collision_threshold {term_collision_threshold} --obs_path {obs_path}
```

Supported tasks:

- `G1Cat`: default task (can be directly used for sim-to-real deployment)
- `G1CatPri`: privileged task (privileged observation is more informative for distilling generalist policies)

Refer to `train_batch.py` for args details.

### brax2onnx

`train_batch.py` will automatically convert checkpoints to ONNX format. But if you customize the policy architecture, you may need to convert checkpoints to ONNX manually:

```bash
python -m cat_ppo.eval.brax2onnx \
  --task G1Cat \
  --exp_name 04271342_G1LocoPFR10_SlowV4_xP2xMxK-004x427Mhurdle
```

### Evaluation

To evaluate the model without privileged observation, run:

```bash
python -m cat_ppo.eval.mj_onnx_play --task G1Cat --exp_name 05180857_G1CatDagger_dagger_v4DG1xG1p0xL1p0xO1p0xT0p0 --obs_path data/assets/TypiObs/side-hurdle-crouch3
```

To evaluate the model with privileged observation, run:

```bash
python -m cat_ppo.eval.mj_onnx_play --task G1CatPri --pri --exp_name 05190650_G1CatPri_V0_xT0p0xforward --obs_path data/assets/TypiObs/forward
```
